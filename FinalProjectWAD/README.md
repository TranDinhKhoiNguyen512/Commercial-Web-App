# POKEMON SHOP
## Chapter 1:  INTRODUCTION

### **Motivation**

The motivation for my team to do this project is to know more professional knowledge and experience working as a team in the same project.

### **Problems Statements**

Initially, my team didn't have any experience working with GitHub groups, it took us a long time to understand how the code works.

We did not have experience in implementing and managing a project, did not know where to start, so we were quite surprised when we started.

The scope of the project is that users can search for Pokemon cards, see the information of the cards and can order and buy cards.

# System Design

### **System Requirement Specification**

##### _Functional Requirements_

Help users: 
- Find and view information of cards
- Buy products on the website.

##### _Requirements Analysis_

We spent more than 2 weeks analyzing the system that needs the data, the necessary requirements for the website to work, the extra pages to make the website more complete and the necessary functions for users to perform.

##### _Non-Functional Requirements_

To make the website more lively, we have applied animation to the buttons that users can use.
In the **_Nav Bar_**, users can select the section they want such as Shop to go to the card search page, News to read the latest information about the card market and About Us to contact us.
